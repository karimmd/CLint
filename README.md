# CLint
Static Analysis Checking Application for C and C++

A new system named CLINT has been designed and implemented as a part of my Graduate Final roject, which can be used to detect security vulnerabilities like buffer overflow, memory leak on the source code of the C and C++ programming language. The results from some several experiments have showed that this system can find possible security vulnerabilities in the software and also can establish the capability and the effectiveness to help the developers creating software with less security flaws in the upcoming days. 

  The principle contents of this research are as follows:
(1)	Based on the background of software security testing, analyzed on the current problems of the buffer overflow vulnerability testing and to identify the research requirements.
(2)	Analyzed on the key concepts such as memory allocation knowledge on the stack and heap area and also the overflow detection methods like static analysis technologies and related systems which are available at present.  
(3)	Designed a vulnerability detection prototype on Windows platform, discussed the design objective, overall design method, core function design and the detail design of the system to understand and realize the class functionality and the main detection methods of the system. 
(4)	Test the system in different units and overall the experiment results that can show the design and implementation are effective, stable and robust.
